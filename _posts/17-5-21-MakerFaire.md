I was very fortunate this year to get invited to attend Maker Faire with [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net/), the awesome San Francisco hackerspace. I've been hanging out at Noisebridge to work on some electronics projects thanks to J at his Circuit Hacking Monday. Noisebridge has dome some really cool projects for Maker Faire in the past like the [Flaschen Taschen](https://github.com/hzeller/flaschen-taschen) a giant LED screen made with beer bottles, milk crates, and powered by a raspberry pi.

This year Noisebridge presented two projects, a really cool VR demo that let people take a virtual tour of the hackerspace, and the Ordibooth. The Ordibooth is a photobooth that takes pictures and uses the traveling salesman algorithm to plot out a portrait drawn in a single line. Then a robotic arm, the axidraw created by Evil Mad Scientist Labs, draws your picture.

It was so much fun to talk to people about hackerspaces and the maker movement. I really loved watching kids get excited about their robotically drawn portraits.
