The awesome folks at [Evil Mad Scientist Labs](http://www.evilmadscientist.com/) invited some of us from Noisebridge to come check out their workshop for a private tour. They are the creators of the awesome pen plotter, the axidraw, that was used in Noisebridge's Ordibooth project for Maker Faire. We got to see their amazing projects up close and ask an embarassing ammount of questions. 

Some of my favorites were the egg-bot, which is an axi-draw that decorates elaborate easter eggs. They even have a version that will decorate ostridge sized eggs. I got to play with meteorite samples, magnets, and a [giant interactive model of a MOS 6502.](http://monster6502.com/). Overall, it was an amazing afternoon. They even gave me a really cool portrait of Sally Yates done on the axidraw. It is so amazing to see a group of professional makers doing what they love and flourishing.


Thanks Windell and Lenore for sharing your creations!
