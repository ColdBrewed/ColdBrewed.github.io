I've been experimenting with some glow-in-the-dark PLA filament. I bought two types, one from Hatchbox and another from MeltInk.
The Hatchbox prints as a opaque white with with a light green cast. The Meltink is a light blue color. I THOUGHT that the blue PLA would glow blue, but as you can see in the image above it's just a paler green. Super disappointing.

Also I'm not super happy with the print quality of the blue MeltInk filament in general. It's very stringy, bad adhesion between layers. I probably tried five different temperature settings, but still haven't gotten a good result. The Hatchbox filament, on the other hand, is amazing. Great flow, great glow, wonderful print quality. Check out some of the other glow prints that I've done.
